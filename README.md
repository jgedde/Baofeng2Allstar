# Baofeng2Allstar

This project allows one or two Baofeng HT's to be connected to a Raspberry Pi Allstar node.  One HT can be connected to make a hotspot.  Two can be connected to make a full-duplex hotspot or a mini-repeater for event or emergency use.

The premise behind this project was to make something "plug and play" with no required modifications to either the Baofeng HTs or the Allstar node's USB sound FOB.
